# A great name for ~~a bar~~ an organization!

The PuZZle in a Mug is a place where we learn, make mistakes, evolve and have fun!

Here I face problems in the scientific mug of every day:

- Lots of coffee to focus ~~data analysis~~ ☕ 
- A lemonade to cool off ~~regression~~ 🍋
- A cold beer to relax ~~normality~~ 🍺
- Sometimes a glass of wine for... ~~references~~ 🍷

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
