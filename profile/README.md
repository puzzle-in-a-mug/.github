# A great name for ~~a bar~~ an organization!

The PuZZle in a Mug is a place where we learn, make mistakes, evolve and have fun!

Here I face problems in the everyday scientific mug:

- Lots of coffee to focus ~~data analysis~~ ‚òï 
- A lemonade to cool off ~~regression~~ üçã
- A cold beer to relax ~~normality~~ üç∫
- Sometimes a glass of wine for... ~~references~~ üç∑


## Packages

Today, I have two packages in alpha phase that can be used (with caution)

### normtest


The `normtest` package contains functions to apply Normality tests. The functions return the conclusion of the test (Rejects or does not reject H0), in addition to the test statistics, critical value and pvalue (when available). Furthermore, graphs can be generated very simply for these tests.

To facilitate its use, classes are also being created that can be injected into parent classes and facilitate data analysis.

Currently the package has two tests implemented:
- Ryan-Joiner;
- Filliben;

In the near future, the Abdi-Molin and Shapiro-Wilk tests will be implemented. The other tests, such as Anderson-Darling, Lilliefors, Shapiro‚ÄìFrancia, are also on the radar, but it will take a while.

You can install the package using pip:

```python
pip install normtest
```

The documentation is available at [https://normtest.readthedocs.io](https://normtest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

### paramcheckup

Package `paramcheckup` is just in its infancy, but we don't have many plans for it. It contains functions that analyze the input of a function, and return a direct and simple error of what the problem with the input is (if any).

These functions can be very useful to help users with little experience in Python, who just want to use a package and not develop something more complex. This is exactly the case with the normtest package, which only analyzes the normality of the data, since a set of data is analyzed only once in relation to the Normality assumption. This is a perfect scenario for classes that apply tests.

You can install the package using pip:

```python
pip install paramcheckup
```

The documentation is available at [https://paramcheckup.readthedocs.io](https://paramcheckup.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
